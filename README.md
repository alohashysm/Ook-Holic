Project Description
An interactive website that detects user emotions and replies with sass answers.Also a few other hidden twist to keep us engaged.

The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Well this is an useless project that doesnt solve real world problems, doesnt improve user life, doesnt motivate you and also not factul at all..

The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Basically solving it didnt need my brain at all. Good at sarcasm was a plus point for me. Well in this project every question has an answer but not the right ones with a sarcastic touch. Hahaha not normal at all. Also, you asked me the solution and i, print "no solution"
