Project Description
A project that deals with the sarcastic level of a user. It is a website that detects users emotions and deals it sarcastically. 

The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Well what more useless that playing with the user itself. This project does have problems with the user, maybe i guess.

The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Solution is the only delution i say to be honest.Every problemn has solution but for a useless problem it needs to create more problems than solution. Well, writing this is the biggest problem i face now.
